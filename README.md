AI Resume Job Matcher
Overview

This AI-powered resume job matcher uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to match resumes with job descriptions. The system utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs), embeddings, and cosine similarity to analyze and compare the semantic meaning of resumes and job postings.

Key Features

Resume and Job Posting Analysis: Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze and extract relevant information from resumes and job postings.
Embeddings and Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical embeddings and vectors, enabling semantic comparison.
Cosine Similarity: Calculates the similarity between resume and job posting vectors, providing a score indicating the match quality.
Ranking and Filtering: Ranks and filters job postings based on their similarity scores, providing the most relevant matches for each resume.
Technical Details

Language Models: Utilizes pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT for text analysis and embedding generation.
Embedding Techniques: Employs techniques like WordPiece embeddings, SentenceTransformers, or Doc2Vec to convert text data into numerical vectors.
Vectorization: Uses libraries like NumPy or SciPy to perform vector operations and calculate cosine similarity.
Ranking and Filtering: Implements ranking and filtering algorithms to prioritize job postings based on their similarity scores.
How it Works

Resume and Job Posting Input: Users input resumes and job postings into the system.
Text Preprocessing: The system preprocesses the text data, removing stop words, punctuation, and performing tokenization.
LLM Analysis: The preprocessed text data is fed into the Large Language Model for analysis and embedding generation.
Embedding and Vectorization: The output embeddings are converted into numerical vectors using techniques like WordPiece embeddings or SentenceTransformers.
Cosine Similarity Calculation: The system calculates the cosine similarity between the resume and job posting vectors.
Ranking and Filtering: The system ranks and filters job postings based on their similarity scores, providing the most relevant matches for each resume.
